TOPICUS ONDERWIJS DASHBOARD
===========================

This project is meant to be an implementation of the [Panic
Dashboard](http://www.panic.com/blog/2010/03/the-panic-status-board/) that was
published by the [Panic team](http://panic.com) in last March.

This is an internal project for Topicus Onderwijs and will ultimately run on a
PC + LCD monitor near our coffee corner. The idea is to show the status of our
production systems, build system, issues, release calendar and other
interesting things that make our company tick.

The project will consist of two parts: a HTML5/CSS3 client and a small light
weight Java server that will aggregate the data for the client from our
production systems.
